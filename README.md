# Imagegallery
An Image Gallery is a web-based feature designed to display a collection of images in a visually appealing and interactive format.

# Key Features:

**Thumbnail View:

Displays images as smaller thumbnails to provide an overview of the gallery.

Makes it easier for users to browse through a large collection without scrolling extensively.

**Interactive Image Preview:

Clicking on a thumbnail opens the image in a larger view (lightbox or modal popup).

Provides a more detailed and immersive experience for users.

**Responsive Design:

Adjusts to different screen sizes and devices (mobile, tablet, desktop).

Ensures images are displayed optimally on any screen resolution.

**Navigation Controls:

Users can move between images using "next" and "previous" buttons or keyboard arrows.

Includes a "close" button to exit the full-size view.

**Zoom and Pan Options (Optional):

Allows users to zoom in and explore finer details of the image.

**Dynamic Content Loading:

For galleries with numerous images, lazy loading or infinite scrolling improves performance by loading images as users scroll.
